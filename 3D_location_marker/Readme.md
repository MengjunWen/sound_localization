# algorithm
use 4 markers in a plane P and 2 more markers in space as the basic reference.
also use the diatance of camera to the plane P and real marker size.
show 3D location on camera frames.
get the idea of calculate "distance from camera to the marker" from: https://github.com/SiliconJelly/OpenCV/tree/main/Distance%20Estimation

# accuracy:
calculated:  
Marker ID 5: Distance to plane p = 94.50 cm   
groundtruth:z = 54 cm  

calculated:  
Marker ID 4: Distance to plane p = 8.17 cm  
groundtruth:z = 45 cm


calculated:  
Marker ID 6: Distance to plane p = 1.68 cm  
groundtruth:z = 0 cm
